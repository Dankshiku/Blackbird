### 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐤𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐡
Shikharsingh is basically an HTTP Denial of Service attack that affects threaded servers. It works like this:

We start making lots of HTTP requests.
We send headers periodically (every ~15 seconds) to keep the connections open.
We never close the connection unless the server does so. If the server closes a connection, we create a new one keep doing the same thing.
This exhausts the servers thread pool and the server can't reply to other people.
