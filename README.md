<h3>Shikharsingh</h3>
Shikharsingh is basically an HTTP Denial of Service attack that affects threaded servers. It works like this:

We start making lots of HTTP requests.
1. We send headers periodically (every ~15 seconds) to keep the connections open.
2. We never close the connection unless the server does so. If the server closes a connection, we create a new one keep doing the same thing.
3. This exhausts the servers thread pool and the server can't reply to other people.
